Magit v2.7.1 Release Notes (draft)
==================================

Changes since v2.7.0
--------------------

* Added several new functions that are suitable values for
  `magit-display-buffer-function':
  `magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1',
  `magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-v1',
  `magit-display-buffer-fullframe-status-topleft-v1', and
  `magit-display-buffer-fullcolumn-most-v1'.

* Added new command `magit-list-repositories'.

* Made `magit-insert-worktrees' use relative filenames.

* Added support for showing and copying bad commit identified by git
  bisect.

* Added new command `magit-branch-orphan'.

* Added new command `magit-log-move-to-parent'.

Fixes since v2.7.0
------------------

* magit-diff-show-or-scroll-{up,down} failed to scroll stash buffers.

* `magit-diff-visit-file' didn't visit a blob when called inside a
  `magit-stash-mode' buffer.

* The function to read the --prefix arg from the subtree popup was
  missing.

* magit-popup-describe-function could create an extra window on wide
  frames.

* Sections in the process buffer sometimes had invalid parent
  sections, causing movement and visibility commands to fail, and
  expected Git errors not to be handled gracefully in some cases.

* Git Rebase mode did not respect the Git variable `core.commentChar'.
